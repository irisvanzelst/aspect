    /**
     * A material model which is intended for use with multiple compositional
     * fields. Each compositional field is meant to be a single rock type,
     * where the value of the field at a point is interpreted to be a volume
     * fraction of that rock type.  If the sum of the compositional field
     * volume fractions is less than one, then the remainder of the volume is
     * assumed to be ``background mantle''.  If the sum of the compositional
     * field volume fractions is greater than one, then they are renormalized
     * to sum to one and there is no background mantle.
     *
     * For each material parameter the user supplies a comma delimited list of
     * length N+1, where N is the number of compositional fields.  The
     * additional field corresponds to the value for background mantle.  They
     * should be ordered ``background, composition1, composition2...''
     *
     * If a single value is given, then all the compositional fields are given
     * that value. Other lengths of lists are not allowed.  For a given
     * compositional field the material parameters are treated as constant,
     * except density, which varies linearly with temperature according to the
     * thermal expansivity.
     *
     * When more than one field is present at a point, they are averaged
     * arithmetically. An exception is viscosity, which may be averaged
     * arithmetically, harmonically, geometrically, or by selecting the
     * viscosity of the composition with the greatest volume fraction.
