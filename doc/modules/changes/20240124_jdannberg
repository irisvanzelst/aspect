Fixed: The latent heat material model now correctly reads in
the Viscosity prefactors that change the viscosities of
individual phases for each compositional field. To make this
work in a consistent way, the format of this input parameter
is now the same as for other phase transition inputs (it is
parsed as a map with keywords rather than a comma-separated
list), which is an incompatible change in the input file.
