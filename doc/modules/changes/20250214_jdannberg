Fixed: If the nonlinear solver fails in a timestep with mesh
refinement and "cut timestep size" is selected as the
Nonlinear solver failure strategy, ASPECT now correctly
repeats the timestep first before refining the mesh. Before,
ASPECT would execute refinement/coarsening of the mesh first,
which could lead to changes of the mesh in each failure
cycle.
