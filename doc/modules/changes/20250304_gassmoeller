Fixed: The statistics file contained an invalid number of iterations
for variables that were not solved (e.g. because compositions were
prescribed, or Stokes was only solved using cheap or only expensive
iterations). This is confusing, because it looks like an error and for the
Stokes solver it caused an incorrect iteration number to be reported. It is
more accurate to report 0 iterations if none were made, which is what the
postprocessor does now.
