Changed: ASPECT's boundary traction and boundary velocity manager classes are
now also derived from the common classes Plugins::ManagerBase. In order to
standardize the interface, the functions get_active_boundary_traction_conditions()
and get_active_boundary_traction_names() (and their velocity counterparts)
have been deprecated. They have been replaced by the new functions get_active_plugins(),
get_active_plugin_boundary_indicators(), get_prescribed_boundary_traction_indicators(),
and get_component_mask().
