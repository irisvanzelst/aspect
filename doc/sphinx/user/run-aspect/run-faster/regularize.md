# Regularizing models with large coefficient variation

Models with large jumps in viscosity and other coefficients present
significant challenges to both discretizations and solvers. In particular,
they can lead to very long solver times. {ref}`sec:cookbooks:sinker-with-averaging` presents
parameters that can help regularize models and these typically also include
significant improvements in run-time.
